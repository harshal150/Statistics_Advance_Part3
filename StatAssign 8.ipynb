    "Q1. Explain the assumptions required to use ANOVA and provide examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) is a statistical method used to compare the means of three or more groups. The ANOVA test assumes several underlying assumptions to be valid, which are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality assumption: The data should follow a normal distribution. The sample means should be normally distributed, and the variances should be equal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence assumption: The observations in each group should be independent of each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneity of variance assumption: The variances of the population should be the same for all groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any of these assumptions are violated, the results of the ANOVA test may not be valid, and the conclusions drawn from the test may be incorrect. Here are some examples of violations that could impact the validity of the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-normality: If the data is not normally distributed, it may lead to inaccurate results. This assumption can be checked using the Shapiro-Wilk test or the normal probability plot. If the data is not normal, the test can be modified or transformed to meet this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lack of independence: If the observations in each group are not independent, it can result in biased estimates of the standard errors of the means, leading to incorrect conclusions. For example, if the data is collected from siblings, the observations in the same family may be correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Violation of homogenity of variance: If the variance of the populations is different across groups, it can lead to biased results."

    "\n",
    "The three types of ANOVA are one-way ANOVA, two-way ANOVA, and repeated measures ANOVA. Each of these types of ANOVA is used in different situations and to answer different research questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "(i) One-way ANOVA: This type of ANOVA is used when we want to compare the means of three or more groups on a single independent variable or factor. For example, if we want to compare the mean test scores of three different groups of students who have received different teaching methods, we can use one-way ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "(ii) Two-way ANOVA: This type of ANOVA is used when we want to examine the effects of two independent variables or factors on a dependent variable. For example, if we want to determine if the test scores of students vary based on both teaching method and gender, we can use two-way ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "(iii) Repeated measures ANOVA: This type of ANOVA is used when we want to compare the means of three or more groups in which the same subjects are measured repeatedly over time or under different conditions. For example, if we want to compare the effects of different dosages of a drug on the same group of patients, we can use repeated measures ANOVA."

    "Q3. What is the partitioning of variance in ANOVA, and why is it important to understand this concept?\n",
    "\n",
    "The partitioning of variance in ANOVA is the process of breaking down the total variance in the dependent variable into different sources of variation, such as the variation between groups and the variation within groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ANOVA, the total variance in the dependent variable is divided into two components: the variance between groups (also known as the \"explained variance\") and the variance within groups (also known as the \"unexplained variance\"). The variance between groups represents the differences in the means of the groups being compared, while the variance within groups represents the differences within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The partitioning of variance is important to understand because it allows us to determine the relative importance of the factors being tested in explaining the variation in the dependent variable. By comparing the variance between groups to the variance within groups, we can determine whether the differences between groups are statistically significant, or whether they are simply due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is useful for understanding the factors that contribute to the outcome being studied and for identifying which variables are most important in explaining the differences between groups. It also helps in designing future studies, by providing information on which variables to control or manipulate to produce the desired outcome."

Pairwise and listwise deletion can reduce the sample size and may introduce bias if the missing data are not missing at random.

    "The pairwise_tukeyhsd function takes two arguments: the combined data from both groups, and a vector indicating which group each observation belongs to. In this case, we concatenate the two arrays of test scores and create a vector indicating that the first 10 observations belong to the control group and the second 10 observations belong to the experimental group. The table indicates that there is a significant difference between the control and experimental groups, with a mean difference of 7.0 and a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.6667 to 13.3333."

    "Q12. A researcher wants to know if there are any significant differences in the average daily sales of three retail stores: Store A, Store B, and Store C. They randomly select 30 days and record the sales for each store on those days. Conduct a repeated measures ANOVA using Python to determine if there are any significant differences in sales between the three stores. If the results are significant, follow up with a post- hoc test to determine which store(s) differ significantly from each other."
